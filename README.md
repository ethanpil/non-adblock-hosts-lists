Useful Non-Adblock Hosts Lists (for PiHole)

In my line of work, I often need to block distracting sites, in addition to ads, tracking and malicious ones. This repository contains the blocklists I manually maintain for my piholes as needed.

* shopping-ecommerce.txt	- Some of the popular e-commerce and shopping sites
* social-media-and-chat.txt	- Social networks and messaging sites and apps
* streaming-audio-hosts.txt	- Music and playlist sites and apps
* streaming-video-hosts.txt - Video streaming sites and apps (non-educational)
